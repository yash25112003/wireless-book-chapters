Please provide the technical claims you would like me to verify. I need the specific statements you want me to fact-check against the standards.  Once you provide the claims, I will: 

1. **Identify the relevant standards:** I will determine which IEEE, 3GPP, or ITU standards are applicable to the claims. 
2. **Analyze the claims:** I will carefully examine the wording of each claim to understand its meaning and scope. 
3. **Cross-reference with standards:** I will search the relevant standards documents for matching or conflicting information. 
4. **Provide a chapter-by-chapter breakdown:** For each claim, I will present a detailed analysis, citing the specific sections and clauses from the standards that support or refute the claim. 
5. **Present a clear conclusion:** I will summarize my findings for each claim, stating whether it is supported by the standards, partially supported, or contradicted. 

Let's get started!
