Please provide me with the technical claims you would like me to verify. I will then cross-reference them against the relevant IEEE, 3GPP, and ITU standards and provide a fact-checked chapter with citations for each claim.  For example, you could ask me to verify claims about:

* **Specific network protocols:**  e.g., "Does Wi-Fi 6 support OFDMA in both uplink and downlink?"
* **Wireless infrastructure capabilities:** e.g., "What is the maximum data rate supported by 5G NR in sub-6 GHz bands?"
* **Standards compliance:** e.g., "Does Bluetooth 5.2 comply with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard?"


The more specific your claims are, the more accurate and helpful my analysis will be.
