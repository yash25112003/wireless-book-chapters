## Chapter 5: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS): Engineering Smart Radio Environments

This chapter explores the transformative potential of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in revolutionizing wireless communication. While the chapter presents compelling arguments and potential applications, a critical analysis requires grounding these claims in authoritative sources and standards. 

**1. Virtual Line-of-Sight (LOS) Paths and Energy Savings:**

The chapter asserts that RIS can create virtual LOS paths, overcoming physical obstructions. This concept aligns with the fundamental principle of RIS, which manipulates the phase and amplitude of electromagnetic (EM) waves to steer and focus signal propagation. 

* **IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6):** While not explicitly addressing RIS, Wi-Fi 6 introduces beamforming techniques that enhance signal directionality and mitigate interference, conceptually similar to RIS functionality. 
* **3GPP 5G NR:** 5G New Radio (NR) standards incorporate advanced beamforming and massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) technologies, enabling similar signal shaping capabilities as RIS.

The claim of up to 85% energy savings compared to traditional relay systems requires further substantiation. While RIS are passive and do not require amplification, their manufacturing, deployment, and control mechanisms still consume energy. 

* **ITU-R M.2135:** This recommendation focuses on energy efficiency in wireless networks but does not specifically address RIS.

**2. Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Environment Enhancement:**

The chapter highlights RIS's potential to significantly boost signal strength in NLOS environments by 300–400%. This claim requires empirical evidence and specific performance metrics.

* **IEEE 802.11ad (WiGig):** This standard utilizes millimeter-wave frequencies, which are more susceptible to NLOS propagation challenges. Research on RIS integration with WiGig could provide insights into potential performance gains.

**3. Cost Reduction and Applications:**

The chapter states a 73% cost reduction in RIS technology since 2020, reaching $5–7 per square centimeter. This information requires verification from industry reports, market analyses, or manufacturer data.

The envisioned applications of RIS, such as smart walls for wireless charging and intelligent beams for security, are promising but require further development and standardization.

* **IEEE P1905.1:** This standard focuses on wireless power transfer, which could be relevant to RIS-enabled wireless charging applications.

**4. Future Intelligent Radio Environments:**

The chapter envisions RIS as a key component of intelligent radio environments that adapt to user needs and environmental changes. This concept aligns with the broader trend of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), which aim to create more flexible and programmable networks.

* **3GPP 5G Core:** The 5G core network architecture incorporates SDN principles, enabling dynamic resource allocation and network slicing, which could be leveraged for RIS-based intelligent radio environments.



**Conclusion:**

While the chapter presents a compelling vision for RIS, a rigorous validation against authoritative sources and standards is crucial. Further research, development, and standardization efforts are needed to fully realize the transformative potential of RIS in shaping the future of wireless communication.
