## Chapter 10: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN): Extending Connectivity Globally from Above

**10.1 Introduction**

This chapter explores the burgeoning field of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), a transformative technology poised to revolutionize global connectivity. NTNs encompass a diverse range of airborne platforms, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS), and drones, which are integrated with terrestrial 6G networks as per 3GPP Release 17 and beyond. 

**10.2 NTN Technology and Standards**

NTNs leverage the principles of wireless communication to provide connectivity from the air.  

* **3GPP Release 17 and Beyond:** The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is the global standards organization for mobile telecommunications. Release 17, published in 2022, includes specifications for NTN integration into 5G networks, laying the groundwork for 6G advancements. [1] 
* **IEEE Standards:** The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) develops standards for various aspects of wireless technology, including radio frequency (RF) communication, network protocols, and security. Relevant IEEE standards for NTNs include:
    * **IEEE 802.11:**  Wi-Fi standards, which may be adapted for use in HAPS and drone networks. [2]
    * **IEEE 802.15:**  Low-rate wireless personal area networks (WPANs), potentially applicable to drone-to-drone communication. [3]
    * **IEEE 802.16:**  Wireless metropolitan area networks (MANs), which could be relevant for HAPS deployments. [4]

**10.3 LEO Satellite NTNs**

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, positioned closer to Earth than traditional geostationary satellites, offer several advantages for NTNs:

* **Lower Latency:**  LEO satellites experience significantly reduced signal propagation delays, resulting in lower latency compared to geostationary satellites. This is crucial for real-time applications like video conferencing and online gaming.
* **Higher Bandwidth:**  LEO constellations can provide higher bandwidth capacity due to their closer proximity to Earth and the ability to utilize multiple satellites for data transmission.

**10.4 Applications of NTNs**

NTNs have the potential to revolutionize various sectors:

* **Bridging the Digital Divide:** NTNs can provide internet access to remote and underserved communities, connecting people who lack terrestrial infrastructure.
* **Maritime and Aviation Connectivity:**  NTNs can enable reliable and ubiquitous connectivity for ships and aircraft, facilitating communication, navigation, and data transfer.
* **Disaster Relief:**  NTNs can quickly establish communication links in disaster-stricken areas, enabling rescue efforts and providing vital information to affected populations.

**10.5 Future Trends**

The NTN landscape is rapidly evolving, with ongoing advancements in satellite technology, 6G networks, and user devices.

* **Direct-to-Smartphone Satellite Links:**  Companies like Apple are exploring direct satellite connectivity for smartphones, enabling global connectivity without relying on terrestrial networks.
* **Integration with 6G Networks:**  NTNs will play a crucial role in the development and deployment of 6G networks, providing seamless connectivity across terrestrial and non-terrestrial environments.

**10.6 Conclusion**

NTNs represent a transformative technology with the potential to reshape global connectivity. By leveraging the power of satellites, drones, and 6G networks, NTNs can bridge the digital divide, connect remote communities, and enable new applications across various sectors. As technology continues to advance, NTNs are poised to play an increasingly vital role in shaping the future of communication and connectivity.
