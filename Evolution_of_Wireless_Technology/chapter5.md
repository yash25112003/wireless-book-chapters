While I can't directly apply formatting without a tool, I can tell you that publishing-grade formatting would typically include:

* **Consistent font and font size:**  Choose a professional, readable font like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri.
* **Proper headings and subheadings:** Use a clear hierarchy of headings to organize the text.
* **White space:**  Use margins, line spacing, and paragraph breaks to make the text easy to read.
* **Lists:** Use bullet points or numbered lists to present information clearly.
* **Tables and figures:** If applicable, use tables and figures to present data in a concise and understandable way.
* **Citations and references:**  Follow a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) for any sources used.
