The provided text is a good start for a section on network slicing in 6G.  

Here's how we can improve the formatting:

* **Heading:**  Use a clear heading like "Network Slicing: A Key Enabler of 6G" 
* **Paragraph Structure:**  Break the paragraph into two for better readability. 
* **Emphasis:** Consider using bold or italics to emphasize key terms like "network slicing" and "6G."

Here's a possible revision:

**Chapter 14: Network Economics**

**Network Slicing: A Key Enabler of 6G**

To thoroughly understand the claims made about network slicing as a key enabler of 6G and its economic implications, it is crucial to delve into the specific standards documents. Access to the IEEE, 3GPP, and ITU standards documents will allow for a direct examination of the functionalities, performance requirements, and potential use cases of network slicing as defined within these authoritative sources. 



This revised text is more visually appealing and easier to read.
