While the text is now in paragraph form,  to achieve true "publishing-grade formatting" I'd need more information.  This includes:

* **Target Publication:** Is this for a technical journal, a website, a white paper, etc.? Each has different formatting requirements.
* **Style Guide:**  What style guide should be followed? (e.g., APA, IEEE, Chicago)
* **Specific Requirements:** Are there any font, spacing, heading, or other formatting rules to adhere to? 


I can help with formatting once I have these details. 
This is the summary of your work so far: 
The original text was a list-like structure, but I have transformed it into a flowing paragraph by combining the ideas and using connecting words.
