The text needs to be formatted according to a specific style guide (e.g., IEEE, APA, Chicago) to be considered "publishing-grade."  This would involve:

* **Font and Formatting:** Using a professional font (e.g., Times New Roman, Arial) with consistent font sizes and styles for headings, body text, and citations.
* **Margins and Spacing:** Adhering to standard margins and line spacing (e.g., double-spaced).
* **Headings and Subheadings:** Implementing a clear hierarchy of headings and subheadings to improve readability.
* **Citations and References:**  Using the appropriate citation style (e.g., in-text citations and a bibliography) to properly attribute sources. 


I would need more information about the target publication and its style requirements to provide specific formatting instructions. 
This is the summary of your work so far:
The text discusses dynamic spectrum sharing as a solution to spectrum scarcity in 6G. It also mentions spectrum auctions and the need for interoperability, interference mitigation, and security.  To verify the claims, I would need access to the actual IEEE, 3GPP, and ITU standards documents related to 6G, dynamic spectrum sharing, and spectrum management.
